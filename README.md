In this project, I employed Kaggle's Red Wine Quality dataset to develop machine learning models that can predict whether a given red wine is of "good quality" or not. Each wine in this dataset has a "quality" score between 0 and 10. For this project, I converted the output into a binary classification, labeling each wine as either "good quality" (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:
Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulfates
Alcohol
