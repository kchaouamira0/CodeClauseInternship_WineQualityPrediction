***Project Overview:

This project aims to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the quality of red wine using a dataset containing various characteristics of different red wines. The project utilizes the Red Wine Quality dataset from Kaggle, which provides information on 11 different features that influence wine quality, including alcohol content, acidity, and sugar content.

***Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to create classification models that can effectively distinguish between "good quality" red wines (score of 7 or higher) and "not good quality" red wines (score below 7). This binary classification will allow winemakers and consumers to make informed decisions regarding wine selection and consumption.
